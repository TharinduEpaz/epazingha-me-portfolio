Maybe you use s3 daily and you knew the facts, maybe you are forgotten. So my idea is to give you a quick knowledge recap, or new knowledge..

## 1. S3 Etags are used to keep track of the objects

<Callout type="note">
Etags are useful if you want to programmatically detect content changes to S3 objects
</Callout>

An entity tag (etag) is a response header that represents a resource that has changed **without the need to download**.
Etags are part of the HTTP protocol.
It reflects changes **only to the contents of an object, not its metadata**.
Etag represents a specific version of an object.
Etags allows clients to quickly verify the integrity of downloaded or uploaded data.

Clients can decide to download or update an object only if the ETag has changed,
**reducing unnecessary transfer** and ensuring consistency.


## 2. You cannot use S3 Express One storage class with general purpose bucket

General purpose (standard) S3 buckets cannot be used with the S3 Express One Zone storage class;
instead, S3 Express One Zone requires a different type of bucket known as an **"S3 directory bucket"**.

S3 directory buckets are specifically designed for this high-performance storage class and are not the same as regular general-purpose S3 buckets.
Only S3 directory buckets allow you to store objects using the Express One Zone storage class,
taking advantage of its ultra-low latency and high throughput features.


## 3. Flat per request charge in Express One Zone Storage class

The flat per-request charge in Amazon S3 Express One Zone means that for any request (such as PUT or GET) where the size
of the request is **up to 512 KB**, a fixed, consistent fee is applied regardless of the actual request size.

If the request size exceeds 512 KB, additional fees are applied per GB for the portion of the request that exceeds 512 KB.
This pricing model simplifies cost calculation for smaller requests by charging a single flat fee and then scaling charges
for larger requests proportionally to their extra data size.

For example:

- Requests ≤ 512 KB incur just the flat per-request charge.

- Requests > 512 KB incur the flat per-request charge **plus an extra fee** based on the size in GB of the data beyond 512 KB.

## 4. S3 Intelligent tiering class has small monthly fee for object monitoring and automation.

S3 Intelligent-Tiering is a powerful option for reducing storage costs automatically,
especially for workloads with unpredictable or changing data access patterns.

It automatically decides which access tier is most suitable according to data access patterns.

This class is best suited for data lakes, analytics, new applications,
and user-generated content where access patterns are unknown or changing.

When we consider about the cost there is a **small monthly monitoring and automation charge per object** that is not appear in the surface. 


## 5. Why you need S3 access points ? 

Imagine you have a big shared folder (S3 bucket) that different teams need to access:

- Marketing team only needs to see promotional images
- Development team only needs access to application files
- Finance team only needs reports

Instead of giving everyone the same "master key" to the entire bucket,
you create **separate access points with different permissions** for each team.

How they work:

- Each access point acts like a specialized doorway
- You can set different rules for each doorway (who can enter, what they can do)
- Teams use their specific access point to get to their data
- Same bucket, different controlled entry points

Real benefit:
Rather than managing complex permissions on one bucket, you create simple, focused access points that make it much easier to control who sees what.
It's like having a receptionist at each entrance who knows exactly what each visitor is allowed to access.

## 6. What is S3 Storage class analysis? how it compares with Intelligent Tiering? 

Storage Class Analysis allows you to analyze storage access patterns of objects 
within a bucket to recommend objects to move between STANDARD to STANDARD_IA

The results can be exported to CSV
export this daily usage data to an S3 bucket
Use data in Amazon QuickSight for data visualization

Storage Class Analysis gives you data and control; Intelligent Tiering gives you automation. 
Use Analysis when you need custom business logic, compliance documentation, 
or want to avoid monitoring fees for smaller datasets.

Bottom Line: Intelligent Tiering is usually better for automation, 
but Storage Class Analysis is still valuable for insights and manual control scenarios.

## 7. Make Your Bucket "Talk": Triggering Lambda & SQS with S3 Event Notifications

S3 Event Notifications allows your bucket to notify other AWS Services about s3 event data.
S3 Event Notifications makes application integration very easy for S3

Possible Destination to other AWS Services
  - Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topics
  - Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queues
  - FIFO not supported
  - AWS Lambda function
  - Amazon EventBridge

  <Callout type="info"> S3 also supports Amazon EventBridge, offering even more complex filtering, retries, and event routing between AWS services.</Callout>

## 8.  You can buy ready-to-use S3 data products directly from AWS Marketplace

AWS Marketplace offers a category called “Data Products” where vendors publish and sell datasets that can be consumed directly via Amazon S3.
When you subscribe to a data product, the provider can grant your AWS account secure, read-only access to their S3 bucket — no downloads, no manual imports.

  Examples:
  - Financial market data (e.g., Nasdaq, Reuters)
  - Geostatic and satellite imagery
  - Demographic or climate datasets
  - Machine learning training data

These datasets often update automatically, 
so your applications or data lake can always pull the latest data from S3 without any integration overhead.

## 9. Versioning can only be suspended — not turned off

Once you enable versioning on a bucket, you cannot disable it completely — you can only suspend it.
Suspension stops new versions from being created, but all previously stored versions remain intact.

This design protects historical data from being lost accidentally and ensures that version history remains traceable.

## 10. Creating Data So Secure, Even YOU Can't Read It

<Callout type="info"> Enterprises protect ultra-sensitive data by encrypting it with **customer-managed keys (CMKs)** in **AWS KMS** — and then locking down key access so tightly that **even the data owners or admins can’t decrypt it**. </Callout>

Data stored in S3 is encrypted using SSE-KMS (Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS).

  - The encryption keys (CMKs) are customer-managed — not controlled by AWS.
  - Enterprises set KMS key policies that:
      - Allow encryption (Encrypt) operations (so apps can write data)
      - But deny decryption (Decrypt) permissions to everyone — including the data creators, admins, or AWS root users.
      - Only a separate, controlled service (or an external key escrow system) can decrypt under strict governance.
